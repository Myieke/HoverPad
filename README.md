# HoverPad
Hoverpad is a simple 8 direction 2 button customizable virtual gamepad/controller for your mouse.
just assign keys on your keyboard to the corresponding hoverpad buttons... 
then hover over each button to activate shoot, jump or direction* buttons. 
activate individual and combination actions [eg. direction and jump at the same time]
left mouse click can also be used anywhere... anytime. 
hoverpad sits over whatever game that you are playing and will only activate when 
you hover within the hoverpad parameters. a no action area is positioned in the centre
and also surrounds the inner circle... resize your hoverpad to suit your needs.
